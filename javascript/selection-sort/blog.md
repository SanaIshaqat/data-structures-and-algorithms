# Selection Sort
## Challenge Setup & Execution
### Branch Name: Selection Sort
Selection Sort is a sorting algorithm that traverses the array multiple times as it slowly builds out the sorting sequence. The traversal keeps track of the minimum value and places it in the front of the array which should be incrementally sorted.

### Sample Arrays
In your blog article, visually show the output of processing this input array:

[8,4,23,42,16,15]

For your own understanding, consider also stepping through these inputs:

Reverse-sorted: [20,18,12,8,5,-2]
Few uniques: [5,12,7,5,5,7]
Nearly-sorted: [2,3,5,7,13,11]

## Write tests to prove the following functionality:

“Happy Path” - Expected outcome
Expected failure
Edge Case (if applicable/obvious)l

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

* ### Analyzed the problem
* ### Thought about the algorithm 
* ### Wrote the coding depending on today's demo
* ### I created the node test as well as LinkedList test
