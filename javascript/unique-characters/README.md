# Challenge Setup & Execution
## Branch Name: hashmap-left-join

### Challenge Type: Code Challenge / Algorithm
Feature Tasks
Write a function that LEFT JOINs two hashmaps into a single data structure.

Write a function called left join
Arguments: two hash maps
The first parameter is a hashmap that has word strings as keys, and a synonym of the key as values.
The second parameter is a hashmap that has word strings as keys, and antonyms of the key as values.
Return: The returned data structure that holds the results is up to you. It doesnâ€™t need to exactly match the output below, so long as it achieves the LEFT JOIN logic.

## Features
Implement a Hashtable Class with the following methods:

- **add**
Arguments: key, value
Returns: nothing
This method should hash the key, and add the key and value pair to the table, handling collisions as needed.
- **get**
Arguments: key
Returns: Value associated with that key in the table

- **contains**
Arguments: key
Returns: Boolean, indicating if the key exists in the table already.

- **hash**
Arguments: key
Returns: Index in the collection for that key

- **repeatedWord**
Write a function called repeated word that finds the first word to occur more than once in a string,Arguments string and Return string.

- **tree_intersection**
Write a function called tree_intersection that takes two binary trees as parameters.
Using your Hashmap implementation as a part of your algorithm, return a set of values found in both trees.

- **hashmap-left-join**
Write a function that LEFT JOINs two hashmaps into a single data structure.

- **unique-characters**
 write a function that will determine if the given string is full of unique characters.
