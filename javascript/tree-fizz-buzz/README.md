# tree-fizz-buzz
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
## Challenge Setup & Execution
### Branch Name: tree-fizz-buzz

## Features

### Node
Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the node, the left child node, and the right child node.

### k-ary tree

Write a function called fizz buzz tree
Arguments: k-ary tree
Return: new k-ary tree
Determine whether or not the value of each node is divisible by 3, 5 or both. Create a new tree with the same structure as the original, but the values modified as follows:

- If the value is divisible by 3, replace the value with “Fizz”
- If the value is divisible by 5, replace the value with “Buzz”
- If the value is divisible by 3 and 5, replace the value with “FizzBuzz”
- If the value is not divisible by 3 or 5, simply turn the number into a String.



## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

* ### Analyzed the problem
* ### Thought about the algorithm 
* ### Wrote the coding depending on today's demo
* ### I created the node test as well as LinkedList test
